Hi. These are the questions that we are going to focus on :

1. What is the spatial distribution of hospitals in Brunei?
   - Analyze the geographic spread and clustering of hospital locations.

2. Are there significant patterns in the distance of hospitals from residential areas?
   - Examine the distances from housing to the nearest hospital.

3. How do the travel times to the nearest hospital vary across the districts?
   - Analyze travel time data to visualize accessibility differences.

4. How does population density relate to hospital distribution?
   - Is there multiple hospital in a high population density area
