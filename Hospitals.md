## 📍❓ QUESTIONS PREVIEW

**No.** | **Research Questions** | **Description** |
|--- | --- | --- |
|1. | **What is the spatial distribution of hospitals and health centers in Brunei?** | *Analyze the geographic spread and clustering of their locations.* |
|2. | **How does population density relate to hospital and health centers distribution?**  | *Investigate if there are multiple healthcare facilities in high population density areas.* |
|3. | **How does the accessibility of healthcare facilities vary across different districts?** | *Compare the accessibility of hospitals and health centers in different districts* |

## 📍 (Question 1.)  What is the spatial distribution of hospitals and health centers in Brunei?
**Our objective**: *Analyze the geographic spread and clustering of their locations.*

<p align="center"><i>Figure : Total of 18 hospitals & healthcare under MOH in Brunei</i></p>


### — 🖊️ **Here is our data overview;**

| District               | Hospitals AND Healthcares |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Brunei Muara district   | 9         |
| Tutong district         | 4         |
| Belait district         | 4         |
| Temburong district      | 1         |


### — 📝 **Our Analysis;**
***1. Brunei Muara district***
* Most of the hospitals are located near to each other
* Indicates a *clustering pattern*
  
***2. ⁠Tutong and Belait district***
* Hospitals are located far from each other
* Hospitals are more *dispersed*, with significant distances between each facility

***3. Temburong district***
* Only 1 Hospital available
* Notably *sparse*, a single hospital serving the entire district as a central healthcare hub for the region

ㅤ

## 📍 (Question 2.)  How does population density relate to hospital and health centers distribution? 
**Our objective**: *Investigate if there are multiple healthcare facilities in high population density areas.*

### — 📝 **Investigating Brunei-Muara district;**

No. | Population Density | Hospital and Health Centres distributions
-- | -- | --
1 | The top part of the district has the highest population density (yellow) of over 10,000 | However, the healthcare facilities are *not as clustered as the center of the district.
2 | The center and bottom part of the district has a high population density (Green areas, Blue areas) ranging from 100 to over 1000 | Shows multiple hospitals and health centres *clustered* heavily in these areas

### — 📝 **Investigating Tutong district;**

No. | Population Density | Hospital and Health Centres distributions
-- | -- | --
1 | High density population on the left sides of the disrict | 2 health facilities on the left side, top and bottom of the district
2 | High population at the center and top of the district | 2 health facilities

ㅤ
**What can be deduced;** 
* Hospital distributions are not as multiple and clustered as Brunei Muara.
* Far from each other, however they are mainly at the center for accessibility.

### — 📝 **Investigating Belait district;**
No. | Population Density | Hospital and Health Centres distributions
-- | -- | --
1 | Has the highest population on the yellow part of the district at the most left side | Multiple healthcare facilities observed (2)
2 | High population on top left and bottom left | For each, only 1 healthcare facility

### — 📝 **Investigating Temburong district;**
No. | Population Density | Hospital and Health Centres distributions
-- | -- | --
1 | population ranging from 1,000-10,000 | No multiple healthcare facilities available (1)

ㅤ

## 📍 (Question 3.) How does the accessibility of healthcare facilities vary across different districts?
**Our objective**: *Compare the accessibility of hospitals and health centers in different districts*

<p align="center"><i>Figure : Comparison between the highways and hospitals of different districts </i></p>


*We will assess accessibility by using the number of highways surrounding the hospitals in each district and their distances. (As a higher number of highways provides more route options, particularly in situations like roadblocks caused by construction )*

### — 📝 **Investigating Brunei-Muara district;**

No. | Highways and Hospitals | Accessibilithy 
-- | -- | --
| 1. | The highways are closely clustered around the hospitals | Easier and quicker to reach hospitals in a short distances | 
| 2. | There are many routes/highways leading to the hospitals (to keep up with the large number of hospitals) | Making hospitals highly accessible |

### — 📝 **Investigating Belait district;**

No. | Highways and Hospitals | Accessibilithy 
-- | -- | --
| 1. | The highways are more spread apart due to the hospitals being further from one another | Slower to reach hospitals due to the distance | 
| 2. | There are at least one or more routes leading to the hospitals | Making hospitals decently accessible |

### — 📝 **Investigating Tutong district;**

No. | Highways and Hospitals | Accessibilithy 
-- | -- | --
| 1. | The highways are more spread apart due to the hospitals being further from one another | Slower to reach hospitals due to the distance | 
| 2. | There are at least one or more routes leading to the hospitals | Making hospitals decently accessible |

### — 📝 **Investigating Temburong district;**

No. | Highways and Hospitals | Accessibilithy 
-- | -- | --
| 1. | The highway is one long distnace leading to the hospital | Slower to reach the hospital due to the long distance | 
| 2. | There is one highway leading to the hospital | Making accessibility to hospitals more limited |


### - 🏁 Overall conclusion:
* Accessibility in Brunei-Muara is higher compared to other districts, whereas in Temburong, it is lower.
* The ranking of accessibility is as follows: Brunei-Muara is the highest, followed by Belait and Tutong, with Temburong having the lowest accessibility.
* This may be attributed to the population density—higher in Brunei-Muara and lower in Temburong (which can be observed in Question 2)—indicating a greater need for accessibility in Brunei-Muara compared to Temburong.
